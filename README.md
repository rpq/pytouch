pytouch
=======

A simple python/pip/virtualenv/easyinstall version manager written in python.  Say you have a bunch of pythons installed in arbitrary locations, then configure pytouch.py and use pytouch.py to select a python version.  This is really useful as a pre virtualenv step because virtualenv does not have the capabilities to swap out python versions cleanly since it depends on python.
